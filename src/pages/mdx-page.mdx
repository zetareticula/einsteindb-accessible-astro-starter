#A Distributed Storage Solution for Large-Scale RDBMS

<Notification type="info">

  <p>
    <strong>Info:</strong>  EinsteinDB supports a multi-level sharding strategy, which uses hash in the uppermost layer, while in each hash-based sharding unit, data is stored in causal order elements named Causets.
  </p>
</Notification>

We support scanning with the stored data generally having a relational table schema, when you want the data of the same table to be as close as possible. EinsteinDB uses multiple Raft groups, which can be combined with a schema-free sharding strategy whose implementation of horizontal scalability is simple.

```js
console.log('Hello Accessible World!')
```

MilevaDB integrate the scheduler and the routing table into one module using FIDel.
